<h2>Life up</h2>
Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default.

<p>
    In the original Pac-Man, the fruits are located below the Ghost House and won't move at all. The fruit appears after 70 dots are eaten and again after 170 dots are eaten unless the first fruit is still there. They will disappear if they are not eaten after 9-10 seconds.
